# 2D Canvas Planner Task

This is a starter application for building your very own Kitchen planner in TypeScript and Canvas 2D!

To get started just clone down the repo and run `npm install` in the directory. To start the app and run a watcher with webpack just run the comand `npm run start:dev`, this will start a server on http://localhost:9000 and automatically rebuild the bundle whenever you edit a file.

Your challenge is to extend the app to do the following:

 - Click and drag kitchen units
 - Collision detection if units overlap
 - Add wall units that can be positioned over the top of base units
 - Add worktop that can be resized
